Step 1: Acquire all relevant inputs and perform the necessary checks on the inputs              - Checking of one value requires one to look into memory
Step 2: Create the class that processes the inputs from step 1 (processing all four initial inputs)                            
Step 3: Fix all additional consideration brought up in step 1
Step 4: Ensure that input gathering component is working perfectly: gathering the initial inputs, making sure incorrect inputs are processed, gathering additional inputs based on the initial inputs, and produce an output that is given to the processing component.
